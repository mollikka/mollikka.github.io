        <p>
            I am Lauri Tervonen, a.k.a. Möllikkä [møl:ik:æ]. I often write my alias as 
            Mollikka as an act of kindness towards all the nice people and
            computers outside Finland.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of my interests include automated testing,
            plane tilings, fractals,
            and procedural content. I'm also into game design, poetry,
            and nature photography.

        <h2><span class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></span>Academic</h2>

        <p>
            I'm a Master of Science in Technology with a major in Computer Science.
            I studied in Aalto University.
        </p>

        <header>
            <h3>Master's thesis: Efficient Distribution of Software Updates</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            I implemented improvements to the automatic software update system in
            Effector healthcare database software developed by Polycon OY.
        </p>
        <p>
            My supervisor was
            <a href="https://users.aalto.fi/~difram1/">Mario Di Francesco</a>
            and my advisor was Magnus Sandberg 
        </p>

        <header>
            <h3>Bachelor's thesis: Strategies in the game Cordial Minuet</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
        I did my Bachelor's thesis in Computer Science at Aalto University in 
        2015. I analyzed
        <a href="http://cordialminuet.com/">Cordial Minuet</a>
        as a zero-sum game and looked for
        strategies that maximize the winnings in a simplified version of the game. I also
        found that the choice of game board might have a some effect on
        expected payoff of the players, which brings an element of luck to the
        official implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
        My advisor on the thesis was <a href="http://theran.lt/">Louis Theran</a>.

            <h3>Teaching</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            In 2014-2016 I taught the fall orientation course for new students at
            Aalto University.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2013-2015 I designed exercises and taught computer class sessions for
            CSE-A1130, an Aalto University applied programming course aimed at
            first year students.

        <h3>Software Engineer at Polycon</h3>
        <p>
          I have been working as a
          software engineer since December 2016.
          I develop database software for Finnish public sector healthcare, and
          maintain the office continuous integration and build system.

        <h3>Lindfors Productions website</h3>
        <p>
          In late 2019, I made a
          <a href="http://lindforsproductions.com">website</a>
          for Lindfors Productions music studio. It has a funny backend
          system that allows the owner to update their portfolio in real time by
          editing a Google Sheets document.
        </p>
        <h3>Oceill's website</h3>
        <p>
          In May 2017, I made a
          <a href="http://oceill.com">landing page</a>
          for the music band Oceill.

        <p><a href="https://mollikka.github.io/GenomeRoll/">
          Breeding Simulator 2016</a>
          is a fully configurable genome calculation tool
          for an adoptable/breeding game community.
          This was made-to-order and I got rewarded for it.

        <p><a href="http://files.mollikka.net/paradox.zip">
                Temporal Paradox</a>
        is a game prototype I made a long time ago,
        in junior high school, I think. I think it's a quite
        entertaining puzzle game with a time travel mechanic.
        The game is provided in Win32 executable form.

            3D printing has allowed many new people to try designing everyday

            It has almost 10 000 downloads as of November 2018.

        <h3>Nintendo cart stands</h3>
        <p>
            Printable Nintendo cart stands (2016) hold all your
            favorite game carts on display, ready to be played. The model

            <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1401060">Hyperboloid pen holder (2016)</a>
            holds 16 pencils nicely on an office desk.
            Hyperboloids are mathematical objects classified as ruled surfaces. This
            means that for each point on the surface, there's a straight line (or in this case,
            a pencil) that goes through that point.

        <p>
            I look at art with my own personal definition: a deliberate product of
            human work that lacks direct external purpose.
            (May not be useful when researching something like Avant-Garde.)
            I find it beautiful that people put tremendous effort into something
            useless.

        <h3>Ydin</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="http://aaltoliike.aalto.fi/index.php/portfolio/ydin/"
                >Ydin (2015)</a>
            is an upcycled paper sculpture. I cut the pages of some photoelectric
            conference proceedings with a paper knife and arranged them into seven
            sheets of roughly 80cm * 80cm.
        </p>

            Ydin was on display at
            <a href="http://www.habitare.fi">Habitare 2015</a>
            in Messukeskus, Helsinki as part of a student exhibition called
            Edited. Edited featured upcycled book art from 7 Aalto University
            students.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Ropina</h3>
        <p>
            Ropina (2015) is a set of textile patterns I designed.
            One variant was on display at 
            <a href="http://math.aalto.fi/en/research/analysis/dg/cfhm/"
                >Crystal Flowers in Halls of Mirrors 2015 exhibition</a>
            in Otaniemi. In the exhibition it was featured as part of a larger
            collection of repeating pattern surfaces, and the sign said
            'Giant 2'.
        </p>
        <p>
            The work was on display in Aalto University, Otakaari 1,
            right outside lecture hall B.

                >Crystal Flowers in Halls of Mirrors exhibition</a>
            in Otaniemi. It's a magnetic gearwork with rotating mirror plates. I worked on
            the concept, building, and Arduino programming.
        </p>

        <h3>Life-vases</h3>
        <p>
            I designed a set of decorative 3D-printed plastic vases, 
            Life (2013).
            Each vase is defined by a mathematical function
            <span class="math">r = f(&#945;,h)</span>.
            There are six vases in the series:
            Lungs,
            Heart,
            Body,
            Toxin,
            Spirit,
            Mind.

        <p>
            Photography is like a hobby to me in that it is a recreational
            activity I regularly do on my free time. Typically I take a day trip
            to a local forest or a zoo and snap two hundred photos. On a good
            day, five of them are presentable.
